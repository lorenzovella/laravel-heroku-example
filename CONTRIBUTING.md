#### PHP Coding style

Contentify follows the [PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) 
with these exceptions:

* All PHP files MUST NOT end with a single blank line.
* The last case segment of a `switch` structure CAN have a `break` keyword. (But usually, we omit it.)
